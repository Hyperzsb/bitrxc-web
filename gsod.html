          </div>
          <div class="project-description">
              Cloudlibz primarily focuses on building tools to enhance the developer experience when developing applications 
              on the cloud. We develop and maintain tools related to cloud automation and provider API unification. Interested in developer
               tooling and cloud computing? You have found the right place. Below are our idea list for 
              Google Season of Docs 2019.

            <h4>Proposal 1: NodeCloud standard interface documentation</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="project-description">
            <p>NodeCloud is an open source Node.js library which unifies cloud provider SDKs. NodeCloud can be used
              as a programmatic interface in application development, and as a tool for provisioning resources on the cloud
              with ease. Providers currently supported are GCP, AWS, and Azure. Library implements a plugin architecture
              which allows the developer to load only the necessary provider SDKs.

              <br/><br/>

              Currently NodeCloud lacks documentation related to standard interfaces which should be followed when developing
              new APIs for plugins of various cloud providers. We require a proper documentation which describes the developer 
              about the steps to create a nodecloud plugin and standard interfaces in NodeCloud which can be used to develop the common
              APIs.

              <br/><br/>

              Expected deliverables: <br/>
              <ul>
                  <li>Documentation of standard interfaces in NodeCloud</li>
                  <li>Wiki on how to create a new NodeCloud plugin</li>
              </ul>

              Skills needed: <br/>
              <ul>
                  <li>Knowledge on how to work with Git and GitHub</li>
                  <li>Fluent in english</li>
                  <li>Basic understanding of how programmatic interfaces work</li>

              <h4>Proposal 2: clocal-gcp documentation</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="project-description">
              <p>cloud-gcp is an easy to use cloud mocking framework. This allows the developer to develop and
                test cloud applications in-house without having to deploy the application to the cloud. Objective of the
                project is to facilitate testing of applications which are intended to be run on the cloud. clocal emulates
                services which are being mostly used by applicaitons.

                Emulated services include functions, storage, memcache, pubsub, datastore and firestore.
  
                <br/><br/>
  
                clocal-gcp currently contains minimum documentation which helps new users and contributors to get started. We believe the
                current documentation can be improved vastly along the following areas. Detailed documentation of each service can
                be added describing in detail what functionalities of each service are emulated. Further limitations of each emulated
                service can be clearly stated, allowing the developers to find and make use of the exact functionalities of the service.
                Further documentation related to developer setup can be improved in order to make it easy for new contributors to provide useful
                additions to the project. Additionaly tutorials can be created which helps developers and contributors to get started with the project
                easily.
